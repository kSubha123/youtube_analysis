Overview
This project implements three adaptive algorithms designed to help YouTube content creators analyze competitor channels, rank channels, and predict video performance for revenue optimization.

ðŸ”Ž Core Algorithms:
âœ… Similar Channels (SC) Algorithm â€” Identifies similar YouTube channels using cosine similarity based on content and engagement metrics.
âœ… Rank Score (RS) Algorithm â€” Computes a weighted rank score for competitor channels based on views, likes, and subscribers.
âœ… Video Analysis (VA) Algorithm with LSTM â€” Applies a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to capture temporal engagement trends and predict top-performing videos.
